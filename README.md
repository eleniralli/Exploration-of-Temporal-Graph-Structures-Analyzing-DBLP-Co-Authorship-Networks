This assignment involved processing raw co-authorship data from the DBLP database to create temporal graphs, analyze their structural properties, and detect influential nodes and communities. The tasks included creating weighted undirected graphs for each year, visualizing the evolution of graph metrics such as the number of vertices, edges, diameter, and average degree, identifying key authors using metrics like Degree and PageRank, and applying various community detection algorithms. The project emphasized hands-on experience with data processing, network analysis, and interpreting temporal trends within dynamic social networks.
